# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![stackone-banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e71fc1d5-e8aa-45ee-9b9c-90f0aa766434)

When working with multiple Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday, integration efforts often become a complicated puzzle. Each system's unique API and data format require custom coding and vigilant maintenance, leading to a network of integrations that is both complex and fragile. 

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

### StackOne simplifies all of this by offering:

* A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
* Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
* Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## Integrating ATS Platforms with StackOne

We've already seen how integrating multiple ATS platforms can be a real challenge. Fortunately, StackOne’s unified API is here to make that process a whole lot easier. Let’s walk through how you can get started and integrate these platforms seamlessly into your application.

### Getting Started with StackOne

First things first—set up your project in StackOne. You’ll need to generate an API key, which is crucial for securing your connections and making sure everything runs smoothly between your app and the ATS platforms. If you need a hand with this, the [Getting Started with StackOne](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/getting-started) guide has got you covered with all the steps.

### Connecting Your Front-End and Back-End

Once your project is set up, it’s time to bring StackOne into your app. Start by embedding the StackOne React Hub into your front-end so users can easily manage their connections. On the back-end, you’ll handle session tokens to keep everything secure and running smoothly. For a step-by-step on this, check out the guides on [embedding the StackOne Hub](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/embedding-the-stackone-hub) and [connecting your back-end](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/connect-your-backend-with-stackone-api).

By following these steps, you’ll be able to integrate multiple ATS platforms into your app with ease, all thanks to StackOne’s simplified approach.

 ### Exploring API Endpoints

  StackOne enables seamless integration with multiple ATS platforms, allowing you to capture and manage accounts, job postings, and applications through a consistent API interface.

**1\. Fetching Accounts Data**

* **Operation: [ Get Accounts ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves account data, including the `accountId`, which is necessary for fetching specific job and application data from StackOne. The `accountId` identifies which ATS platforms' data should be accessed.  

**2\. Fetching Job Data**

* **Operation: [ Get Jobs Data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_jobs)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches job data associated with the provided `accountId`. It allows the job board to retrieve job listings from StackOne that are aggregated from various ATS platforms.  

**3\. Fetching Job Applications**

* **Operation: [ Get Applications data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_applications)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves application data related to the `accountId`. It provides a list of job applications, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the data from multiple ATS platforms.  

**4\.  Displaying Job Postings to Candidates**

* **Operation: [ Get Job postings data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_job_postings)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches all available job postings. It provides a comprehensive list of job opportunities for users to view and apply for on the job board.  

**5\. Applying for Jobs**

* **Operation: [ Create Application](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_create_application)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint is used to submit a new job application. The job board sends the application details to StackOne, which forwards them to the appropriate ATS platform for processing.  

## Conclusion and Recommendations

**Conclusion**:

Integrating multiple ATS platforms into a unified job board with StackOne simplifies job management and provides a single, consistent interface for users. This centralization ensures up-to-date job listings and streamlined application processes.

**Recommendation:**

**Secure API Keys and Credentials:** Use environment variables to store sensitive information and implement access controls to restrict API key usage to authorized components and users.
