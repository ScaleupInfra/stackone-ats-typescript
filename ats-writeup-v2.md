# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![stackone-banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e71fc1d5-e8aa-45ee-9b9c-90f0aa766434)

When working with multiple Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday, integration efforts often become a complicated puzzle. Each system's unique API and data format require custom coding and vigilant maintenance, leading to a network of integrations that is both complex and fragile. 

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

### StackOne simplifies all of this by offering:

* A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
* Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
* Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## Integrating ATS Platforms with StackOne

### 1. Setting Up StackOne Connection:
   * To get started with StackOne, log in to the platform and navigate to the Integrations page from the dashboard. From there, you can easily link and manage connections with various ATS platforms.
   * For more detailed guidance on setting up these connections, refer to this documentation [here](https://stackone-60.mintlify.app/dashboard/accounts).

### 2. Generating API Key on StackOne:
   * To securely connect your application with StackOne, you’ll need to generate and manage API Key. These keys will authenticate your application and ensure secure data access.
   * For detailed steps on generating API key, refer to this documentation [here](https://stackone-60.mintlify.app/dashboard/api-keys).

### 3. Generating and Managing Session Tokens:

  To securely connect your application with StackOne, you'll need to generate and manage session tokens. These tokens authenticate your application and ensure that only authorized interactions occur.

   1. **Prepare the API Key:**
        - Ensure your API key is securely stored. This key is essential for authenticating requests when generating session tokens.
   2. **Generate and Store the Session Token Securely:**
        - Generate the session token, securely store it. Refer to this [Create connect-session](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_create_connect_session).
   3. **Using the Session Token:** 
        - Include the session token when initializing the StackOne Hub to securely display the interface for connecting accounts. Refer to [Detailed guide on embedding StackOne.](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/embedding-the-stackone-hub)

### 4. Managing Integrations Data
     
  The Integrations section of the StackOne dashboard allows you to manage integration (aka provider) for a StackOne Project. Manage, enable, and configure integrations for your StackOne 
  project using the [Integrations page](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/project-integrations).

 ### Exploring API Endpoints

  StackOne enables seamless integration with multiple ATS platforms, allowing you to capture and manage accounts, job postings, and applications through a consistent API interface.

**1\. Fetching Accounts Data**

* **Operation: [ Get Accounts ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves account data, including the `accountId`, which is necessary for fetching specific job and application data from StackOne. The `accountId` identifies which ATS platforms' data should be accessed.  

**2\. Fetching Job Data**

* **Operation: [ Get Jobs Data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_jobs)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches job data associated with the provided `accountId`. It allows the job board to retrieve job listings from StackOne that are aggregated from various ATS platforms.  

**3\. Fetching Job Applications**

* **Operation: [ Get Applications data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_applications)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves application data related to the `accountId`. It provides a list of job applications, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the data from multiple ATS platforms.  

**4\.  Displaying Job Postings to Candidates**

* **Operation: [ Get Job postings data ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_job_postings)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches all available job postings. It provides a comprehensive list of job opportunities for users to view and apply for on the job board.  

**5\. Applying for Jobs**

* **Operation: [ Create Application](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_create_application)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint is used to submit a new job application. The job board sends the application details to StackOne, which forwards them to the appropriate ATS platform for processing.  

## Conclusion and Recommendations

**Conclusion**:

Integrating multiple ATS platforms into a unified job board with StackOne simplifies job management and provides a single, consistent interface for users. This centralization ensures up-to-date job listings and streamlined application processes.

**Recommendation:**

**Secure API Keys and Credentials:** Use environment variables to store sensitive information and implement access controls to restrict API key usage to authorized components and users.
