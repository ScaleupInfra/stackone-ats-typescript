# Streamlining Your HR Processes: Employee Onboarding with StackOne's ATS and HRIS Integration

When building an HR portal designed to onboard newly hired employees from ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday into your HRIS system, you might initially think it's a straightforward task. However, the reality is that each ATS platform comes with its own unique API and data format, necessitating custom integrations for each one. This approach can quickly escalate in complexity, leading to a system that's difficult to maintain and prone to issues.

As your organization grows and the number of hires increases, managing these integrations can quickly become overwhelming, leading to a fragile, inefficient process. Without a unified approach, youâ€™re likely to face:

* **High maintenance costs** as you constantly update custom code to keep integrations functional.
* **Inconsistent data handling** that increases the risk of errors, causing delays and frustration during the onboarding process.
* **Scalability issues** that make it difficult to efficiently add new ATS platforms or expand operations.
