To connect your application with StackOne securely, you need to generate API keys. These keys authenticate your application and protect your data.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Generating an API Key

### 1. Access the API Key Management Section:
* Log in to StackOne and go to the "API Keys" section in the left navigation menu. 
* This is where you can generate and manage your API keys.

### 2. Generate a New API Key:
* Click the "Create API Key" button. In the popup dialog, enter a name for your key (e.g., "stackone-ats-key"). 
* This name is a label and cannot be changed later. Click "Generate" to create your unique API key.

### 3. Securely Store the API Key:
* The API key will be displayed on-screen. Copy it immediately and store it securely, as this is the only time it will be shown. 
* If you lose the key, you'll need to generate a new one. Store the key in a secure location, such as a password manager.

### 4. Managing API Keys:
* The new API key will be listed in the "API Keys" tab. 
* You can view, revoke, or regenerate keys as needed, such as if there's a security issue.

**Note:** The API key is required for all future API calls. Paste it in either the username field for basic authentication in any API endpoints, such as [List Accounts](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts).

### Recommendation:

Secure API Keys and Credentials: Use environment variables to store sensitive information and implement access controls to restrict API key usage to authorized components and users.
