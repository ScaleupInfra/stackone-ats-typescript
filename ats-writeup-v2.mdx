# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![](/stackone-banner.png)

Imagine you're building a job board that needs to pull listings from multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday. Each platform has its own API and data format, requiring custom code and constant maintenance. 

As the number of integrations grows, so does the complexity—leading to a fragile and time-consuming system.

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

<Card title="StackOne simplifies all of this by offering:" icon="square-terminal" iconType="duotone">
- • A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
- • Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
- • Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## API Interaction Overview

When building your job board, you’ll need to efficiently display jobs and manage applications from various ATS providers like Greenhouse, Ashby, and others. To streamline this process, we will be using StackOne’s ATS endpoints to integrate and synchronize data across multiple platforms.

Understanding the sequence of API calls and data flow is crucial to making this integration work seamlessly. The diagram below illustrates how these interactions occur—from the moment a user engages with your job board to the retrieval of job listings and application data from the ATS providers. 

This structured API flow ensures that your job board remains responsive, accurate, and able to handle data from diverse sources with minimal complexity.

 ### Exploring API Endpoints

Let’s dive deeper into some of the key ATS endpoints that StackOne provides to make integrating with multiple platforms straightforward and consistent.

These endpoints form the backbone of how your job board interacts with various ATS systems, ensuring that data flows seamlessly from account management to job applications.

**1. Fetching Accounts Data**

* **Operation: [ GET /accounts ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves the account information, including the `accountId`. The `accountId` is crucial for identifying which ATS platform's data will be accessed for further operations, such as fetching jobs and applications.  

**2. Fetching Job Data**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/jobs ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_jobs)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches job data associated with the provided `accountId`. It allows the job board to retrieve job listings from StackOne aggregated from various ATS platforms.  

**3. Fetching Job Applications**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/applications ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_applications)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves application data related to the `accountId`. It provides a list of job applications, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the data from multiple ATS platforms.  

**4.  Displaying Job Postings to Candidates**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/job_postings ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_job_postings)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches all available job postings, providing a complete list of opportunities for candidates to view and apply for through your job board.

**5. Applying for Jobs**

* **Operation: [ POST /ats/applications ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_create_application)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint allows candidates to submit job applications. The job board sends the application details to StackOne, which then forwards them to the appropriate ATS platform for processing.

By utilizing these endpoints, your job board can seamlessly interact with multiple ATS platforms, offering a consistent and efficient experience for both users and administrators.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we walked through the process of creating a job board that integrates with multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse and Ashby. By using StackOne’s unified API, we were able to minimize the effort required to connect to these different systems. StackOne streamlined the integration process, allowing us to manage jobs and applications across various platforms without the need for custom coding or extensive maintenance.

StackOne made building and maintaining the job board straightforward, allowing us to focus on delivering a seamless user experience while keeping everything responsive and up-to-date with ease.
