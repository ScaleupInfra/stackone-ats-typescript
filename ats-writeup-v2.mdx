# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![](/stackone-banner.png)

Imagine you're building a job board that needs to pull listings from multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday. Each platform has its own API and data format, requiring custom code and constant maintenance. 

As the number of integrations grows, so does the complexity—leading to a fragile and time-consuming system.

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

<Card title="StackOne simplifies all of this by offering:" icon="square-terminal" iconType="duotone">
- • A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
- • Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
- • Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## Integrating ATS Platforms: Key Steps and System Interactions for Your Job Board

When building your job board, you’ll need to display jobs and manage applications from various ATS providers like Greenhouse, Ashby, and others. To streamline this process, we will be using StackOne’s ATS endpoints to integrate and synchronize data across multiple platforms.

Understanding the sequence of API calls is crucial to making this integration work seamlessly. The diagram below illustrates how these interactions occur—from the moment a user engages with your job board to the retrieval of job listings and application data from the ATS providers.

### Steps to Building a Job Board Using StackOne

When building a job board that integrates with multiple ATS platforms there are several steps involved. Each step corresponds to a specific operation within StackOne, which handles the necessary API interactions to fetch, display, and manage job listings and applications. Below are the steps needed to create a functional job board using StackOne.

**1. Fetching All ATS Accounts to Display Jobs and Applications**

The first step in setting up your job board is to fetch all available ATS accounts. This operation retrieves the account information, including the accountId, which is crucial for identifying which ATS platform's data will be accessed for further operations. This allows HR professionals to select any ATS account from which they want to view jobs and applications. By displaying all connected ATS accounts, the job board provides a centralized interface for managing multiple platforms. 

- API Call: [GET /accounts](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts)

**2. Displaying Job Listings from Multiple ATS Providers**

After an ATS account is selected, the next step is to fetch the job listings associated with that account. This API call translates the interface and retrieves job data from the selected ATS platform, which is then displayed on the job board. This step enables HR professionals to view job listings from any selected ATS account, making it easier to manage job openings across different platforms through a single interface.

- API Call: [GET /ats/jobs](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_jobs)

**3. Displaying Applications from Multiple ATS Providers**

After fetching job listings, you’ll also need to display the candidate applications associated with those jobs. This operation retrieves application data related to the selected accountId, ensuring that all candidate applications are accessible in one place. HR professionals can view candidate applications for any selected ATS account, streamlining the process of managing and reviewing applications across multiple platforms.

- API Call: [GET /ats/applications](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_applications)

**4. Displaying Job Postings to Candidates**

To keep your job board’s listings up-to-date and accessible to candidates, this API call retrieves job postings from the selected ATS accounts. The endpoint translates the interface and fetches the data, allowing you to present a comprehensive list of job opportunities on your job board. 

- API Call: [GET /ats/job_postings](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_job_postings)

**5. Submitting Job Applications**

In this step of the job board process, we are enabling candidates to submit their job applications. This operation sends the application details from the job board to StackOne, which then forwards them to the appropriate ATS platform for processing. This allows candidates to apply for jobs directly through your job board, ensuring that their applications are correctly submitted and tracked by the respective ATS platform.

- API Call: [POST /ats/applications](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_create_application)

## Conclusion

In this walkthrough, we explored the process of creating a job board that integrates with multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse and Ashby. By using StackOne’s unified API, we minimized the effort required to connect these systems. StackOne streamlined the integration process, enabling us to manage jobs and applications across various platforms without the need for custom coding or extensive maintenance.
