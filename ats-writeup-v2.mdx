# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![](/stackone-banner.png)

Imagine you're building a job board that needs to pull listings from multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday. Each platform has its own API and data format, requiring custom code and constant maintenance. 

As the number of integrations grows, so does the complexity—leading to a fragile and time-consuming system.

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

<Card title="StackOne simplifies all of this by offering:" icon="square-terminal" iconType="duotone">
- • A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
- • Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
- • Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## Integrating ATS Platforms with StackOne

We've already seen how integrating multiple ATS platforms can be a real challenge. Fortunately, StackOne’s unified API is here to make that process a whole lot easier. Let’s walk through how you can get started and integrate these platforms seamlessly into your application.

### Getting Started with StackOne

First things first—set up your project in StackOne. You’ll need to generate an API key, which is crucial for securing your connections and making sure everything runs smoothly between your app and the ATS platforms. If you need a hand with this, the [Getting Started with StackOne](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/getting-started) guide has got you covered with all the steps.

### Connecting Your Front-End and Back-End

Once your project is set up, it’s time to bring StackOne into your app. Start by embedding the StackOne React Hub into your front-end so users can easily manage their connections. On the back-end, you’ll handle session tokens to keep everything secure and running smoothly. For a step-by-step on this, check out the guides on [embedding the StackOne Hub](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/embedding-the-stackone-hub) and [connecting your back-end](https://docs.stackone.com/docs/connect-your-backend-with-stackone-api).

By following these steps, you’ll be able to integrate multiple ATS platforms into your app with ease, all thanks to StackOne’s simplified approach.


## API Interaction Overview

To effectively integrate multiple ATS platforms using StackOne, it's important to understand the sequence of API calls and how data flows through the system. 

The following diagram illustrates the interaction flow between the user, your job board, StackOne, and the ATS providers.

 ### Exploring API Endpoints

Let’s dive deeper into some of the key ATS endpoints that StackOne provides to make integrating with multiple platforms straightforward and consistent.

These endpoints form the backbone of how your job board interacts with various ATS systems, ensuring that data flows seamlessly from account management to job applications.

**1. Fetching Accounts Data**

* **Operation: [ GET /accounts ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/stackone_list_linked_accounts)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves the account information, including the `accountId`. The `accountId` is crucial for identifying which ATS platform's data will be accessed for further operations, such as fetching jobs and applications.  

**2. Fetching Job Data**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/jobs ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_jobs)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches job data associated with the provided `accountId`. It allows the job board to retrieve job listings from StackOne aggregated from various ATS platforms.  

**3. Fetching Job Applications**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/applications ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_applications)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint retrieves application data related to the `accountId`. It provides a list of job applications, ensuring consistency and uniformity in the data from multiple ATS platforms.  

**4.  Displaying Job Postings to Candidates**

* **Operation: [ GET /ats/job_postings ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_list_job_postings)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint fetches all available job postings, providing a complete list of opportunities for candidates to view and apply for through your job board.

**5. Applying for Jobs**

* **Operation: [ POST /ats/applications ](https://docs.stackone.com/reference/ats_create_application)**  
* **Purpose**: This endpoint allows candidates to submit job applications. The job board sends the application details to StackOne, which then forwards them to the appropriate ATS platform for processing.

By utilizing these endpoints, your job board can seamlessly interact with multiple ATS platforms, offering a consistent and efficient experience for both users and administrators.

## Conclusion

Integrating multiple ATS platforms can quickly become a daunting task, but StackOne makes it much easier by providing a unified API. This not only simplifies your integration process but also helps you avoid the headaches of custom coding and constant maintenance.
