# Simplifying Integrations Across Disparate ATS: A Job Board Using StackOne

![](/stackone-banner.png)

Imagine you're building a job board that needs to pull listings from multiple ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Ashby, and Workday. Each platform has its own API and data format, requiring custom code and constant maintenance. 

As the number of integrations grows, so does the complexity—leading to a fragile and time-consuming system.

Managing these integrations can quickly become a burden, consuming valuable time and resources. Without a unified solution, you’re likely to face:

* Repetitive and tedious coding for each ATS, making the integration process time-consuming and error-prone.
* Ongoing maintenance burdens as you try to keep all integrations functional with every API update.
* Frustration with traditional iPaaS solutions that are complex to implement and come with high costs.

- • A unified API that allows you to connect to multiple ATS platforms with minimal effort.
- • Consistent data formats across all integrations, reducing the need for custom code.
- • Scalability that lets you easily add new ATS platforms as your needs grow.

With StackOne, you can move beyond the grind of manual integrations and focus on building the features that truly matter.

## API Interaction Overview

When building your job board, you’ll need to efficiently display jobs and manage applications from various ATS providers like Greenhouse, Ashby, and others. To streamline this process, we will be using StackOne’s ATS endpoints to integrate and synchronize data across multiple platforms.

Understanding the sequence of API calls and data flow is crucial to making this integration work seamlessly. The diagram below illustrates how these interactions occur—from the moment a user engages with your job board to the retrieval of job listings and application data from the ATS providers. 

This structured API flow ensures that your job board remains responsive, accurate, and able to handle data from diverse sources with minimal complexity.
